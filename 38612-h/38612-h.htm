London&rsquo;s famous town,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis easy now to look<br />
At City Scenes, and London gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this my little book.</p>
<p>Yes, there in quiet you may sit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the winter&rsquo;s fire,<br />
And see and hear as much of it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As ever you desire.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; That stands upon the green,<br />
May pass the summer&rsquo;s eve away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And view each City Scene.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s great St. Paul&rsquo;s, so wondrous wide,<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is Farmer Clodpole, who lives
a hundred miles from London, coming to see it at
last.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have just reached the top of a
hill, and catch a fine view of the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! is that <i>Lunnun</i>, coachey?&nbsp; Well,
I&rsquo;m glad to see it at last; for I, that&rsquo;s only used
to jog along a few miles in our cart, don&rsquo;t much fancy this
jumbling and jolting.&nbsp; But what a smoke they are in, master
coachman: I shall be glad enough to get back again, if I am
always to be in such a <i>puther</i>.&nbsp; Pray, what&rsquo;s
that there great round thing in the midst of the housen?&nbsp;
Oh! St. Paul&rsquo;s: why that beats our parish church all to
pieces.&nbsp; Well, drive away, coachey, that I may see all the
fine things; and nobody shall laugh at me any more, because I
have not seen <i>Lunnun</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>2.&nbsp;
The Monument.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/pic2b.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Monument"
title=
"The Monument"
src="images/pic2s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>There is the Monument: it is situated on the east side of Fish
Street Hill, and is the highest column in the world.&nbsp; It was
erected in remembrance of the great fire of London, which broke
out in <i>Pudding Lane</i>, very near Fish-Street Hill,
destroying all the buildings from Tower Wharf in the east, to
Temple church in the west; and from the north end of Mincing
Lane, to the west end of Leadenhall Street; passing to
Threadneedle Street, thence in a direct line to Holborn Bridge,
and extending northward to Smithfield, when, after having burnt
down thirteen thousand and two hundred houses, it terminated.</p>
<p>At that time provisions were very cheap, and many people eat
to the full; so that gluttony was alleged by some as the cause of
the fire; it beginning, as they said, at <i>Pudding Lane</i>, and
ending at <i>Pie Corner</i>, which was the case.</p>
<p>The Monument is a very fine pillar, 202 feet high, having a
staircase leading to the gallery, from which, on a clear day,
beautiful views of the city and surrounding country may be
seen.</p>
<p>By the inscription on the Monument, the Roman Catholics are
accused of &ldquo;burning this <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Protestant city;&rdquo; but Pope, the
poet, was of a different opinion, for he says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;London&rsquo;s high column, pointing to the
skies,<br />
Like a tall bully, lifts its head and lies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3.&nbsp; Pie Corner,</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">

<p>West Smithfield, where you see the white projecting house, as
it was left after the fire of London, which took place at
midnight, 2d September, 1666, and burnt with unabated fury till
the 10th of the same month.</p>
<p>There is also, at the corner of the lane, against a public
house called the Fortune of War, a figure of a boy carved in
wood, on which was painted an inscription to commemorate the
event, and also stating the calamity to have been a punishment on
the city for the sin of gluttony; but this being since considered
a vulgar error, is not painted on the new figure, which in other
respects is exactly like the old figure first put up.</p>
<h3>4.&nbsp; New London Bridge.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/pic4b.jpg">
<img alt=
"New London Bridge"
title=
"New London Bridge"
src="images/pic4s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The new London Bridge is built from a design of the late John
Rennie, Esq. engineer; <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and the works are conducted under the
direction of John and George Rennie, Esqrs.&nbsp; It stands a
short distance westward of the old bridge.&nbsp; The first stone
was laid by John Garratt, Esq. lord mayor, on the 15th of June,
1825.</p>
<p>This bridge consists of five arches: the centre one is 150,
those next to it 140 feet, the extreme arches 130 feet.&nbsp; The
roadway is nearly level, and the parapet is plain, with
buttresses rising from the piers,</p>
<h3>5.&nbsp; Billingsgate,</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/pic5b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Billingsgate"
title=
"Billingsgate"
src="images/pic5s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The only fish-market in London, to which the fishing-smacks
bring their cargoes.&nbsp; Whoever goes to Billingsgate, at
market-time, must expect to be pushed about and dirtied.&nbsp;
The crowd is generally very great, and the people very noisy, and
some are quite abusive to strangers.</p>
<blockquote><p>There goes a tall fish-woman sounding her cry,<br
/>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll buy my fine flounders, and oysters
who&rsquo;ll buy?&rdquo;<br />
Poor flounder, he heaves up his fin with a sigh,<br />
And thinks that <i>he</i> has most occasion to cry;<br />
&ldquo;Ah, neighbour,&rdquo; says oyster, &ldquo;indeed, so do
I.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is supposed that more money is taken at this place for
shell-fish, in a year, than there is at <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Smithfield for butchers&rsquo; meat in
the same period.&nbsp; Within these few years, great quantities
of salmon have been sent from Scotland to Billingsgate in
summer-time, preserved in ice, which had been stored up in winter
for that salutary purpose.&nbsp; The ice, when taken from the
fish, is sold to confectioners and pastry-cooks, for forming
ice-creams in summer.</p>
<h3>6.&nbsp; The Scavenger.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/pic6b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>I am glad to see this man, whose business it is to sweep up
the mud and dirt from the streets, and collect it in a
cart.&nbsp; Surely, no part of London needs this work more than
Thames Street and Billingsgate; for, even in a dry season, the
narrowness of the streets, and great traffic of men and women,
with fish in wet baskets, &amp;c. keep the pavement constantly
dirty.&nbsp; When the cart is well laden, he empties it into some
waste place in the outskirts of the town, or delivers it at some
wharf by the water-side; and as it proves a very rich manure, he
finds it a profitable and useful occupation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad &rsquo;tis not my
luck<br />
To get my bread by carting muck;<br />
I&rsquo;m sure I never could be made<br />
To work at such a dirty trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Hold, little master, not so fast,<br />
Some proud folks get a fall at last;<br />
And you, young gentleman, I say,<br />
May be a scavenger, one day.<br />
All sober folks, who seldom play,<br />
But get their bread some honest way,<br />
Though not to wealth or honours born,<br />
Deserve respect instead of scorn.<br />
Such rude contempt they merit less,<br />
Than those who live in idleness;<br />
Who are less useful, I&rsquo;m afraid,<br />
Than this black mud that&rsquo;s in my spade.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>7.&nbsp; The Bellman.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/pic7b.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Bellman"
title=
"The Bellman"
src="images/pic7s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Well, here is the Bellman and Crier, calling the attention of
the people to a description of a child that has been lost.&nbsp;
The number of children who have at times been stolen from their
homes, has caused great alarm to many parents.&nbsp; It was not
far from London Bridge that little Tommy Dellow was taken away,
which caused the parish-officers to advertise a reward of one
hundred guineas for his recovery; and the bills were the means of
his being discovered at Gosport, in Hampshire.&nbsp; It appeared
that this little boy and his sister were enticed away by a
decently <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>dressed woman, who sent the girl home, but took the
boy.&nbsp; Having no children of her own, she contrived to take
him to Gosport, and to present him to her husband, on his return
from a long voyage at sea, as his own son.&nbsp; The whole
history of the distressing loss and happy recovery of little
Thomas Dellow, has been published; and, in another account of
him, <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a> it is shortly described in verse.</p>
<p>The little boy and girl, who stand hand in hand, before the
man with the basket on his head, are the portraits drawn from the
life of little Thomas Dellow and his sister.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A sweet
chubby fellow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Named little Tom Dellow,<br />
His mamma to a neighbour did send,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a caution to stop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a green-grocer&rsquo;s shop,<br
/>
While she went to visit a friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The poor little
soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unused to control,<br />
O&rsquo;er the threshold just happen&rsquo;d to stray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a sly cunning dame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary Magnay by name,<br />
Enticed the young truant away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>&ldquo;At a pastry-cook&rsquo;s
shop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She made a short stop,<br />
And gave him two buns and a tart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And soon after that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bought him a hat<br />
And feather, that made him quite smart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then a man they
employ<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To describe the sweet boy,<br />
Whom they sought with such tender regard!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And soon you might meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bills in every street,<br />
Which offer&rsquo;d five guineas reward!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They did not
succeed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To discover the deed,<br />
Tho&rsquo; much all who heard of it wonder&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till at length they sent down<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Large bills to each town,<br />
And raised the reward to one hundred!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The office of bellman was first instituted in 1556, for the
purpose of going round the ward by night to ring his bell, and to
exhort the inhabitants, with a loud voice, to take care of their
fires and lights, to help the poor, and pray for the dead.&nbsp;
This custom, though once general, is used only at Christmas-time,
when a copy of verses is repeated, instead of the admonition used
in former days.</p>

<a href="images/pic8b.jpg">
<img alt=

title=
"A wharf"
src="images/pic8s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Is a landing place by the side of a river, for the convenience
of boats, barges, or ships.&nbsp; At these wharfs many casks of
fruit, plums, currants, figs, oranges, and lemons, are brought on
shore, to be taken away in carts to grocers, fruiterers, and
orange-merchants.&nbsp; It is the business of a merchant to bring
over these things for our use, and for which we are obliged to
him.&nbsp; The West and East India Docks receive now, most of the
shipping used to and from those countries, and are considered
more secure from robberies, than the open wharfs by the sides of
the river Thames used to be.</p>
<h3>9.&nbsp; The Coal-ship and Barge.</h3>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>This is one of the ships called Newcastle Colliers, laden with
coals from the mines in Northumberland.&nbsp; These vessels are
too large to come close to the wharfs to unload; so the coals are
emptied into barges, (which are a kind of large, flat boats,) and
carried in them to the different wharfs where they are to be
landed.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Drawn up from the dreary mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; See the black and shining coal;<br />
Where the sun can never shine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the deep and dismal hole.</p>
<p>There the sooty miners stay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Digging at their work forlorn;<br />
Or, to see the light of day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a swinging bucket drawn.</p>
<p>Then along the roaring tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the tempest bellow&rsquo;d keen,<br />
Did the laden vessel ride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toss&rsquo;d among the waters green.</p>
<p>Wide were spread her canvass sails,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tall and taper rose her mast:<br />
Now, before the northern gales,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She has reach&rsquo;d her port at last.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Adjoining Billingsgate stands the New Custom House, which is
the office where the duties are collected on goods exported or
imported.&nbsp; The building is situated in Lower Thames-street,
fronting the river, occupying an immense space of ground.&nbsp;
The dimensions of it are upwards of 480 feet long, by 107 feet
wide.&nbsp; The first stone <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>was laid on the 25th of October,
1813, being the 53d anniversary of king George the Third&rsquo;s
accession; and it was opened for public business on the 12th of
May, 1817.</p>
<p>The long room is of extraordinary size, being 190 feet long,
by 66 wide, and proportionably high.&nbsp; This is the principal
place for all foreign business.</p>
<p>The former Custom House having been burnt down, precautions
have been taken to prevent the recurrence of a similar accident
in the new building; and fire-proof rooms are provided on each
floor, where the books and papers are deposited every
evening.</p>

</a></p>
<p>From the Custom House it is but a few steps to
Tower-hill.&nbsp; Well, there is a view of it, and of the Tender,
which is an old man-of-war, riding at anchor on the Thames, for
the purpose of receiving impressed men for the king&rsquo;s
service.</p>
<blockquote><p>Say, Mr. Lieutenant, before I surrender,<br />
By what right you take me on board of your tender?<br />
In the peaceable trader I rather would be,<br />
And no man-of-war, Sir, I thank you, for me.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/pic12b.jpg">
<img alt=

title=
"The Tower of London"
src="images/pic12s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Is an ancient and irregular building, which arises from its
having been erected and enlarged by different sovereigns, at
distant periods of time.&nbsp; It was the palace of many of our
monarchs, as well as a place of defence.&nbsp; William of
Normandy, called the Conqueror, having no great reliance on the
fidelity of his new subjects, built a fortress, (called the White
Tower,) on part of the present scite of the Tower, to which the
origin of this fabric may be attributed.&nbsp; In 1092, William
Rufus laid the foundation of a castle to the south, towards the
river, which was finished by his successor.&nbsp; Beneath this
were two gates, one called <i>Traitor&rsquo;s</i> Gate, through
which state-prisoners were conveyed to their prisons; the other
entitled <i>Bloody</i>, which, too many who entered it, found it
deserved; imprisonment in those dark ages, being mostly the
certain passport to death. <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp; Charles the
Second cleared the ditch, improved <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the wharfings, and introduced water
by convenient sluices.&nbsp; The whole underwent considerable
repairs in the reign of George the Third.</p>
<p>The principal entrance is by three gates on the west
side.&nbsp; The whole are guarded by soldiers; and when these
gates are opened of a morning, the formalities of a garrison are
observed, though the interior now resembles a town at peace,
having streets, and a variety of buildings.&nbsp; When the gates
are shut at night, the Yeoman Porter, with a serjeant and six
privates, goes to the governor&rsquo;s house for the keys, and on
the porter&rsquo;s returning from the outer gate, he is
challenged by the guard, drawn up under arms, with, &ldquo;<i>Who
comes there</i>?&rdquo; to which he replies, &ldquo;<i>The
Keys</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The guards answer, &ldquo;<i>Pass
Keys</i>,&rdquo; and rest their firelocks.&nbsp; The yeoman
porter says, &ldquo;<i>God save the King</i>!&rdquo; and the
ceremony closes with a general &ldquo;<i>Amen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wardens, or Yeomen Porters of the Tower, wear a uniform,
the same as the yeomen <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>of the king&rsquo;s guard at the
palaces.&nbsp; Their coats are of fine scarlet cloth, laced with
gold round the edges and seams, with several rows of gold lace,
and bound round the waist with a girdle of the same
material.&nbsp; Their form is uncommon, having full sleeves, and
short, full skirts.&nbsp; On their breasts and backs they wear
the king&rsquo;s silver badge of the rose, thistle, and shamrock,
with the letters G. R.&nbsp; Their heads are covered with round,
flat-crowned caps, tied with bands of coloured ribbons.&nbsp; The
whole appearance forms an elegant livery, well adapted to
royalty.</p>

<p>The spoils of the Spanish Armada are still shown in the
Tower.&nbsp; There are, amongst them, several kinds of arms and
instruments of cruelty, designed for torturing their English
prisoners; and the following list of them will prove the
barbarity of Spain at that period.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">THE SPOILS
OF THE SPANISH ARMADA.</span></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The pope&rsquo;s banner, by him blessed and declared
invincible.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A battle-axe for penetrating steel armour.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>3.&nbsp; A spadole, used as a small sword, the point
poisoned.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; An anchove, for hooking men off their horses.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; A lance.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; A lance, with the current coin on the head.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; A Spanish morning star: the points were poisoned, to
keep people from boarding ships.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; A lance, which the Spaniards vauntingly said was for
bleeding the English.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; A battle-axe with a pistol at the end.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; A battle-axe.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; A Spanish bilbo, to lock the English by the
legs.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; A thumb-screw, an instrument of torture.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; A Spanish instrument of torture, called the
cravat.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; A Spanish shield with a pistol fixed in it.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; A battle-axe, or scull-cracker, to make four holes
at a blow.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; The Spanish general&rsquo;s shield of honour.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; Spike-shot.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; Bar-shot.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The figure of Queen Elizabeth in armour, forms a proper
addition to the collection.&nbsp; She stands in a spirited
attitude, by a cream-coloured horse, attended by her page.&nbsp;
The axe that beheaded the unfortunate Ann Boleyn, wife of the
cruel King Henry the Eighth, is also shown here.&nbsp; The small
armoury contains stands of <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>arms for one hundred thousand men,
tastefully arranged in a variety of figures.&nbsp; The apartment
is three hundred and forty-five feet in length, and is thought to
exceed every thing of the kind in Europe.</p>
<h3>14.&nbsp; The Horse Armory.</h3>

</a></p>
<p>The Horse Armory is a large apartment, containing, amongst
many curiosities, seventeen of the kings of England on horseback,
in the suits of armour they had each worn.&nbsp; Most of this
armour is very rich, and beautifully ornamented.&nbsp; The
furniture of the horses is of velvet, laced with gold.</p>
<p>There is a suit of armour belonging to John of Gaunt, Duke of
Lancaster, which is seven feet high; and another made for Henry
the Eighth, when sixteen years old, which is six feet in
height.</p>
<h3>15.&nbsp; The Wild Beasts in the Tower.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

title=

src="images/pic15s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But no sight in the Tower is more interesting than the wild
beasts: lions, tigers, leopards, bears, monkeys, &amp;c.&nbsp; As
they are confined in <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>cages, with iron gates before them,
there is no danger, if people keep their distance; but some
dreadful accidents have happened, by children going within reach
of the paws of the lion, she bear, or tiger.</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t be frighten&rsquo;d, young lady, to
look at the lion,<br />
You see he can&rsquo;t spring through the grating of iron;<br />
But if you were wand&rsquo;ring, like poor Mungo Park,<br />
In Africa&rsquo;s forests, bewilder&rsquo;d and dark;<br />
And there, where no refuge or hut could be found,<br />
Should hear his fierce roar thro&rsquo; the valleys around;<br />
Or there, by the moonlight, astonish&rsquo;d to stand,<br />
And see his huge shadow glide by on the sand;<br />
Oh, then you might tremble with terror, and fly<br />
And hide &rsquo;mid the palm-tree till he had passed by:<br />
An enemy fierce and all-powerful then,<br />
But now a poor captive confined in his den.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>16.&nbsp; The Jewel Office.</h3>
<p>This office is a strong stone room, in which are kept the
crown, ball, and sceptre, used by the kings of England at their
coronation, all richly set with jewels; besides other crowns and
regal ornaments, and some pieces of curious old plate.&nbsp; The
crown worn by the king when he goes in state to the House of
Lords, is enriched <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>with an emerald seven inches round, with other gems of
great value.&nbsp; Great precautions are taken to secure the
regalia, the whole being enclosed within a grate.&nbsp; This was
found needful in the days of Charles the Second, after a daring,
unprincipled man, named <i>Blood</i>, had attempted to steal the
crown and other royal ornaments.&nbsp; Under the form of a
clergyman, and pretended friendship to Mr. Edwards, who was
keeper of the jewels, he introduced three of his companions, as
wicked as himself, and having knocked down and gagged the
unsuspecting old man, they concealed the crown and other
valuables under their clothes, and were going off with their
booty, leaving the keeper, as they supposed, dead, or stunned
with their blows, on the floor; but he never lost his senses, and
taking advantage of their security, forced out the gag, and
calling for assistance, pursued the villains, and recovered the
spoil!</p>

<p>7.&nbsp; The culanna, or pointless sword, being the sword of
mercy.</p>
<p>8 and 9.&nbsp; The swords of justice, spiritual and
temporal.</p>
<h3>17.&nbsp; Rag Fair and Old Clothes.</h3>
<p>Not far from the Tower is Rosemary Lane, where Rag Fair is
daily held.&nbsp; To describe the great variety there sold, would
exceed all bounds; we would, however, advise every country
customer who visits that place, to take particular care of his
pockets, that the money depart not without his consent; and, if
he takes change, to see well that the silver be good.&nbsp; A
word to the wise is sufficient.&nbsp; But as many dealers in old
clothes know that an industrious disposition is worth more than
good opportunities without it; and as nothing is to be got by
standing still, up old Levi gets early in the morning, and
rambles about from street to street, and buys old clothes of
those who have got new ones: or sometimes he gets a stock of hats
and slippers, and then begins his walk again.&nbsp; So, as he
wants his money more than he does his goods, he sells them to
those who <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>want the goods more than they want their money.&nbsp;
Thus both parties are accommodated.&nbsp; This is the business of
a trader; and his customers are as much obliged to him for
letting them have his things, as he is to them for letting him
have their money.</p>
<h3>18.&nbsp; Ship-building.</h3>
<p>Now we have a distant view of a man-of-war (which is a great
fighting ship) building at Deptford.&nbsp; You may see, by the
boats in the front, how large it must be; for the further off any
thing is, the smaller it looks; and yet it seems larger at this
distance, than the boats which are close by.&nbsp; It is like a
large floating house, with convenient apartments, sufficient to
accommodate 800 people.&nbsp; Numbers of men have been at work on
it for several years; and hundreds of fine oaks, which have been
from fifty to a hundred years in growing, have been cut down to
build it with: besides all the iron from Sweden, for bolts and
nails; and fir-trees from Norway, for planks and masts; and
copper from Cornwall, to cover its bottom with, to preserve it
from being rotted by the sea-water and from other injuries; and
the pitch, tar, <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>paint, glue, and I cannot tell how many other things,
which must be used before it is fit to swim.&nbsp; What a pity
that all this expense and trouble should be wasted in contriving
to kill our neighbours and destroy their property; when it might
be employed to the advantage of both parties by promoting a
friendly intercourse with each other.</p>

<p>I wish the bear had remained in Russia or Poland, rather than,
after being brought from his native woods, to be thus tormented;
for who can tell what misery he underwent in learning to move at
the command of his keeper.&nbsp; And as for the poor dogs, they
must be very tired before their day&rsquo;s work is ended.&nbsp;
I would rather find employment for the men, than give them money

<p>What a wonderful place is this said London!&nbsp; Here are not
only bears from the cold regions of <a name="page27"></a><span

a camel from the hot sands of Arabia or the East Indies, walking
in the streets!&nbsp; Behold the playful monkey on its head, and
numbers of fearless boys upon its back.&nbsp; In Turkey, Arabia,
and Persia, the camel is a most useful creature, carrying very
great weights of spices and merchandise, for a considerable
number of miles, and for several days together, without any kind
of sustenance.&nbsp; They are said to have a particular property,
in scenting out places in the sand where water is to be
found.</p>
<p>The milk of this animal is very nutritive, and, mixed with
water, forms the principle beverage of the Arabians.&nbsp; The
flesh supplies them with food: that of the young is reckoned a
delicacy.</p>
<p>The camel feeds entirely on vegetables.&nbsp; Not only pencils
and brushes for painters, but some very neat and fine garments
have been made with its hair.</p>
<blockquote><p>In Arabian deserts bare,<br />
I have toil&rsquo;d with patient care,<br />

</a></p>
<p>Here merchants meet from all parts of the world.&nbsp; The
traffic on the seas being very great, to and from every nation,
in time of peace, it must afford great convenience to the
ship-owners, ship-captains, and traders, to have one spot where
they can meet to transact their business.&nbsp; Sir Thomas
Gresham, a merchant, laid the foundation in 1566, and Queen
Elizabeth was so pleased with the building, that she dignified it
with the title of <i>Royal Exchange</i>, by sound of trumpet.</p>
<p>The inside of the Exchange affords a busy scene: Englishmen,
Dutchmen, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Russians, Turks, Americans, and
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Jews.&nbsp; How intent every one appears to be on
business, and what a general buzz and din we hear: yet the figure
of one individual stands very silently in the midst of all, I
mean the statue of Charles the Second, on a pedestal.&nbsp; In a
few years, every one of these active merchants will be as
motionless as this marble statue.&nbsp; It may be of service to
the busy Englishman, sprightly Frenchman, lazy Spaniard,
plodding-Dutchman, rough Russian, proud Turk, and rich Jew, to
reflect on this; and to endeavour, with all their gettings, to
get understanding.</p>

<p>We know of no place better supplied with engines for putting
out fire, than London; and though fires are very frequent, they
seldom do so much damage as formerly, when houses were built of
wood, or without party-walls.</p>
<p>An engine is a very clever contrivance: the pipes convey the
water over the tops of the houses; and if an engine arrives in
time, it frequently prevents the flames from spreading further.

<h3>28.&nbsp; The East India House.</h3>
<p>The East India Company is one of the most powerful and wealthy
associations in Europe; <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>and their house in Leadenhall Street
is a very elegant building.&nbsp; The Company was originally
formed by Queen Elizabeth, in 1600, principally for the purpose
of procuring spices at a cheap rate, which were advanced in price
by the Dutch.&nbsp; From traders they became conquerors of the
natives, and having obtained a footing in the country, usurped
the sovereignty over considerable districts; and war, with
oppression, have too often befallen the harmless natives.&nbsp;
The India ships bring home tea, coffee, silks both raw and
manufactured, cottons, muslins, calicoes, drugs, China-ware,
rice, sago, saltpetre, pepper, indigo, &amp;c &amp;c.</p>

Swithin&rsquo;s church, where it has long been preserved.&nbsp;
It is now cased with stone-work, and guarded by an iron bar and

<p>This is the place where the public business of the corporation
of London is transacted; and where the judges sit to hear and
determine causes.&nbsp; In this hall the Court of Aldermen and
Common Council have a very handsome chamber, or court-room, which
is ornamented with a capital collection of paintings, presented
to the City of London by the late worthy Alderman Boydell, who
greatly promoted the arts.&nbsp; The fine painting by Mr. Copley,
representing the siege of Gibraltar by the Spanish flotilla, and
likewise an elegant marble statue of George III. our late
venerable monarch, are well worth seeing by every admirer of the
arts of painting and statuary.</p>
<p>Nearly opposite to the entrance of this fine building, and on
each side of the clock, formerly stood two gigantic statues,
commonly called Gog and Magog, supposed to be the figures of a
Briton and a Saxon; but they are now removed to the west end of
the hall, as they are seen in the picture, No. 31.</p>
<p>Two modern painted windows complete the decorations of this

sellers of stock, or those who are engaged in transferring it,
all so eagerly occupied with their affairs, and showing their
anxiety by their countenances.&nbsp; Where money is, there the

<p>This is a wonderfully fine building! and the
countryman&rsquo;s amazement on first seeing it, is very
naturally expressed in the following lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of all the brave churches I ever did see,<br />
Sure this seems the greatest and grandest to me!<br />
What a wonderful place!&nbsp; I am full of surprise,<br />
And hardly know how to believe my own eyes.<br />
Why sure that gold cross at the top is so high,<br />
That it must, now and then, prick a hole in the sky;<br />
And, for my part, I should not be much in amaze,<br />
If the moon should run foul of it, one of these days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not only the outside of this fine building that commands
attention, but the inside also.&nbsp; The whispering gallery, the
great bell, the library, and so many other curiosities are to be
seen, that even to name the whole would require more space than
we can afford in our little work.</p>
<p>A young country gentleman, who was never before on any thing
higher than a haystack, has now reached the top of St.
Paul&rsquo;s, and is admiring the prospect from the iron
gallery.</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, certainly, this is a wonderful sight;<br />
And pays one for climbing up here such a height.<br />
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Dear, what
a large city! and full, in all parts,<br />
Of churches and houses, of horses and carts.<br />

I could stand here all <i>day</i> to behold this fine town;<br />
Tho&rsquo;, as night&rsquo;s coming on, I had better go down.</p>

<p>I think so too, young gentleman: and mind how you go along the
dark staircase, for it would be a sad thing to fall down among
that frightful scaffolding.&nbsp; Walk gently, and lay hold of

<p>Their singular dress consists of a coat of blue cloth, formed

wear a yellow woollen petticoat.&nbsp; Their stockings are of
yellow worsted, and round their waist they buckle a red-leather

<p>This is what might have been expected, my lad!&nbsp; You have
been teasing and worrying that animal, till it is become quite
furious, and now you must take the consequence.&nbsp; It was as
tame and quiet as any ox in Smithfield, till you began to pull it
by the tail, and beat it about the horns; and now, (as oxen do
not know they ought not to be revengeful,) you cannot be
surprised if it should give you a toss or two.&nbsp; Cruel folks
are always cowardly, and it is no wonder to see you running away
in such a dreadful fright.</p>

<p>In one of the print-shops of London may be seen a
representation of the taking of Guy Fawkes, in the reign of King
James the First.&nbsp; In the year 1605, the plot to destroy the
king and parliament was discovered, owing to an anonymous letter
sent to Lord Monteagle.&nbsp; In a cellar under the
parliament-house, there were found thirty-six barrels of
gunpowder; upon which were laid bars of iron, massy stones,
faggots, &amp;c.&nbsp; Near these Guy Fawkes was concealed, with
a dark lantern and three <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>matches.&nbsp; He instantly confessed
his guilt; and, with Sir Everard Digby, Catesby, and several
others, was executed.</p>

<p>Every parish in England formerly used to have its <i>Pope</i>
or <i>Guy</i> carried about by idle men and boys on the 5th of
November, who usually went from house to house, begging for money
to make a bonfire and a feast.&nbsp; In many of the villages near
London, there used to be two or more parties of large boys from
different parts of the parish; and it frequently happened, that
when one of them thought the other had encroached, by visiting
such houses for money as were deemed out of their bounds, that
battles were fought between them.&nbsp; Many were lamed in these
affrays, and the treasurer to the weakest party has often been
plundered of such money as had been collected.</p>
<p>The people of England in general, of late <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>years, have
discouraged these processions and riots, and they have become so
insignificant, as to be noticed only by children.&nbsp; But even
in the present time, some idle people will fire guns, and throw
squibs into the streets, which have caused many serious
accidents; and here seems some poor creature going to</p>

</a></p>
<p>Which is in West Smithfield, and where all persons
accidentally injured, are admitted at any hour of the day or
night, and carefully attended by skilful surgeons, and proper
nurses.&nbsp; This hospital has long remained a monument of the
piety of its founder, &mdash; Rahere, who was minstrel, or
jester, to King Henry the First.&nbsp; Grown weary of the gay
offices of his station, he reformed, founded a priory, and
established this hospital for the sick and maimed.&nbsp; It was
granted by King Henry the Eighth, on certain conditions, to the
City of London, in the last year of his reign, for the same
purposes as those of its original foundation.&nbsp; The present
building was erected in the reign of George the Second, in
1730.</p>

<a href="images/pic41b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Is in a large, open, square place, called West Smithfield;
where is held, for three days in the week, a market for hay and
straw; and the other three days for horses and cattle of all
kinds, which make the place very dirty and inelegant in its
appearance.&nbsp; Various have been the purposes, at different
periods, to which this place has been applied, it having been
equally devoted to festive joy, and extreme misery.&nbsp; Here,
in the days of chivalry, the court and nobility held their
gallant tilts and tournaments, with a magnificent parade,
characteristic of the age.&nbsp; On the same spot, for a series
of years, have been enjoyed by the lowest vulgar, the buffoonery
humours of Bartholomew Fair, which was first granted by Henry the
Second, to a neighbouring priory, as a mart for selling the
commodities of the drapers of London, and clothiers of
England.&nbsp; As other channels for the disposing of drapery
goods arose, this fair, from a resort of business, became a
meeting of pleasure.&nbsp; It continues three days, to the great
annoyance of real trade and decorum; and a court of
<i>pie-powder</i> is held daily, to settle the disputes of the
people who frequent it.&nbsp; On the other hand, in ancient
times, it was the <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>common place of execution for criminals.&nbsp; In the
centre of the place now enclosed with rails, many martyrs were
burned at the stake, for their adherence to the reformed
religion; and, lastly, it was the field of combat, when the guilt
of the accused was attempted to be decided by duel.</p>
<p>There has been of late years, a show of fat cattle annually at
Smithfield, and the feeders of the best kinds have been rewarded
with money, or a piece of valuable plate, which has greatly
contributed to encourage the improvement of various breeds of
sheep and cattle.</p>

<p>This is in Fleet Street, and had a very narrow escape from the
great fire of 1666, which stopped within three houses of
it.&nbsp; There are two savage figures on the outside of the
clock, that strike the quarters with their clubs, with which
children and strangers are much amused.&nbsp; Dunstan, before he
was made a saint, was well skilled in many arts: he was a good
engraver and worker in brass and iron.&nbsp; He was supposed to
be the inventor of the <i>Eolian Harp</i>, whose soft notes are
produced by a current <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>of air causing the wires to
vibrate.&nbsp; This was not comprehended by the vulgar; so, from
being wiser than his neighbours, he was deemed a conjuror by
them.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Make haste, my good lad, or the postman may be gone.&nbsp;
These letter-carriers begin to ring a bell about five
o&rsquo;clock every evening, and collect letters and newspapers
in the several parts of the town, so as to be able to get to the
General Post Office in time for sorting them for the
mail-coaches.</p>
<p>The gentleman&rsquo;s servant with the letter, seems to be
sent from some lawyer in the Temple, as there is a view of the
gardens and fountain.</p>
<h3>44.&nbsp; The Temple</h3>
<p>Is a place of residence for students of the common law,
divided into two societies, called the Inner and the Middle
Temple, which, with the other law-associations, are called Inns
of <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>Court.&nbsp; The buildings of the Temple are ample and
numerous, with pleasant gardens extending to the shores of the
Thames, which prove agreeable retreats to young persons who have
been engaged in study.</p>
<h3>45.&nbsp; The Knife-grinder.</h3>

<a href="images/pic45b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>This man seems to be very busy, and it is but reasonable to
suppose that he may meet with many employers amongst the students
of the law, and the law-stationers, in and about the Temple: for
as they use many pens, a sharp knife must be quite needful for
mending them.&nbsp; But I think he does not confine himself to
grinding knives only, but when wanting a job, he cries,
&ldquo;Knives to grind!&nbsp; Scissors to grind!&nbsp; Razors to
grind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well! who would believe it? why, that is lazy Tom, turned
knife-grinder at last!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, master, and I never was so happy in my life.&nbsp;
I thought, like a foolish old fellow, that a beggar&rsquo;s life
must at least be an easy one; but at last I found out, that,
though I had nothing to do, I often had nothing to eat.&nbsp; So,
one day, I thought to myself, thinks I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a vast
mind to bestir myself, and work <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>for my living, for after all this
idling, I don&rsquo;t see that I am much of a gentleman for
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I bought this grinding barrow, and began
business for myself; and now I earn a comfortable living, and am
as happy as the day is long:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And so every body who tries it, will
find:<br />
I wish you good morning, Sir&mdash;Scissors to grind!&rdquo;</p>

If I&rsquo;d as much money as I could spend,<br />
I&rsquo;d leave off crying, old chairs to mend!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps so, but then you might not be more healthy, useful, or
happy, than at present.&nbsp; Exercise and sobriety contribute to
health, and industry produces the means of procuring wealth
sufficient to live in a comfortable manner.&nbsp; A
chair-bottomer is a very useful man: he contributes to the ease
and comfort of many of his employers; yet, one cannot help
asking, Has every chair which wants a new bottom, been worn out
fairly?&nbsp; What! have no little boys, or great girls, been
standing up in them? <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>or drawing them up and down the house
and yard, to wear out the rushes?</p>
<p>During the war with Holland, rushes for bottoming chairs were
very scarce and dear, so that the poor men in that line of
business found a great difficulty to obtain materials and
employment.</p>
<p>This man, although he appears poor, yet he occupies the
highest situation in the city of London, having taken his seat in
Panyer Alley, leading from Newgate Street to Paternoster Row;
where a stone is placed, in the wall of one of the houses, with
the following inscription in old English verse:</p>

place.&nbsp; The news-boy would be very glad to have a hot

to hear what the news is.&nbsp; So that they are not only <i>busy
men</i>, but what is very different, <i>men of
business</i>.&nbsp; They are passing by <i>The Obelisk</i>, in
Fleet Street, built by the City of London, on the spot which was

Bridge, under that part which Fleet Market is now built upon.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Here we have a view of Blackfriars&rsquo; Bridge, and, from
the great bustle there is upon the river, there seems to be a
rowing match among several watermen.&nbsp; This bridge is a noble
structure, consisting of nine arches, the centre one being one
hundred feet wide.&nbsp; Over each pier is a recess, with seats
for passengers on the bridge, supported by two beautiful Ionic
pillars, which stand on a semi-circular projection, rising above
high-water mark; and the whole <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>appears an admirable piece of
workmanship, upon the water.&nbsp; This bridge was begun in the
year 1760, from a design of Robert Mylne, Esq. the architect, and
finished in about eight years, at the expence of rather more than
one hundred and fifty thousand pounds.</p>
<p>Blackfriars&rsquo; Bridge is a very pleasant place for a walk,
especially on a fine summer&rsquo;s evening, when the air is
still and serene, and the light pleasure-boats are gliding up and
down the river with their gay companies.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful sight to see the sun setting from this
place: it shines upon the great dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s, in all
its glory, and makes it look as if it were made of gold.&nbsp;
The watermen are always waiting about the bridges, and keep a
brisk cry of Boat! boat, who wants a boat?&nbsp; Oars, Sir!
sculler, Sir!</p>

</a></p>
<p>Temple Bar is a noble gateway of stone, with a large arch in
the centre for carriages, and a covered path on each side for
foot-passengers.&nbsp; It is now the only gate standing, except
St. John&rsquo;s Gate, Smithfield, out of the <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>many formerly
used at the several principal entries into the city.&nbsp; On
some public occasions, as, when the king or any of the royal
family come into the city, or on a proclamation of peace, this
gate is shut and opened with great formality.&nbsp; On the latter
occasion, the gates of Temple Bar are shut, to show that the
jurisdiction of the city is under the Lord Mayor.&nbsp; The
knight-marshal, with his officers, having reached this barrier of
city authority, the trumpets are sounded thrice; and the junior
officer of arms riding up to the gate, knocks with a cane.&nbsp;
The city marshal within demands, &ldquo;Who comes
there?&rdquo;&nbsp; The herald replies, &ldquo;The officers of
arms, who ask entrance into the city, to publish his
majesty&rsquo;s proclamation of peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this the
gates are opened, and he alone is admitted; when, being conducted
to the Lord Mayor, he shows the royal warrant, which his lordship
having read and returned, he orders the city marshal to open the
gates.&nbsp; This being done, the heralds resume their places;
and the procession, joined by the city magistrates, proceeds to
the Royal Exchange, where the proclamation is read.</p>
<p>The very great improvements already made from Temple Bar
towards St. James&rsquo;s, have cost so considerable a sum of
money, that the <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>destruction of this gate, or bar, has been delayed much
longer than was expected.&nbsp; The upper part of it was used of
late years as an office for publishing the Star newspaper.</p>
<p>Shortly after the rebellion of 1745, the heads of three rebel
noblemen were fixed on three poles, on the top of the gate, where
they remained till they decayed, or were blown down by a high
wind.</p>

</a></p>
<p>When we see a rope, with a wisp of straw tied to it, across
the street, no carriage should attempt to pass, for that is the
pavior&rsquo;s signal that the road is stopped, by their being at
work on the stones.&nbsp; And hard work it seems to be, to use
the heavy rammer.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Does not each walker know the warning
sign,<br />
When wisps of straw depend upon the twine<br />
Cross the close street, that then the pavior&rsquo;s art<br />
Renews the way, denied to coach or cart?<br />
For thee the sturdy pavior thumps the ground,<br />
Whilst every stroke his labouring lungs resound.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stones for paving London are mostly brought from the
quarries of Scotland, by ships; <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>and very few towns or cities in
Europe are better paved than the City of London.&nbsp; Indeed,
every year seems to add improvements, for the health and comfort
of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The country farmer, who has been used to nothing but ploughed
fields, and uneven, rutted lanes, or, at best, to the rough
gravel of a cross-country road, would be surprised to see the
streets of London paved as neatly as Farmer Furrowdale&rsquo;s
kitchen, and the lamps lighted as regularly every evening, as
that in the great hall at the &rsquo;squires.&nbsp; And now, by
the introduction of gas, the principal streets are very
brilliantly illuminated, without the aid of tallow, oil, or
cotton.</p>

<p>There seems to be one more great person removed from this
life, and going in a hearse with six horses, to his last
home.&nbsp; Westminster Abbey is a fine Gothic pile, and was
founded by <i>Sebert</i>, king of the East Saxons, but at what
time is uncertain.&nbsp; In this place the kings and queens of
England have been crowned, ever since the days of Pope Nicholas
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the
Second, who appointed it for their inauguration.&nbsp; The
coronation chairs are kept here, and the seat of the most ancient
one is the stone on which the kings of Scotland used to be
crowned, brought to Westminster by Edward the First.</p>
<p>The great number of monuments, and other curiosities of this
venerable building, with the variety of pavements and chapels,
are well worthy of a visit from every enquiring stranger; but the
insertion of a full description here, would be more than can be
expected.</p>

<p>There is a Westminster scholar, and he appears to be
explaining the particulars of some Latin inscription, to his
mother and sister, who have called to see him.&nbsp; Methinks I
hear the lady say, &ldquo;See, my dear children, what the richest
and greatest come to at last.&nbsp; Rich and poor, high and low,
must all be laid in the grave; and though this noble monument
appears very grand to the living, it makes no difference to
&lsquo;the poor inhabitant below,&rsquo; whether he lies <a

<p>Is admired both for the grandeur and simplicity which are
united in its several parts.&nbsp; Henry, Earl of Pembroke,
promoted the erection of this bridge, and laid the first stone,
in the beginning of the year 1739.&nbsp; It has thirteen arches,
exclusive of a very small one at each end.&nbsp; The foundation
is laid on a solid bed of gravel, and the piers are solid blocks
of Portland stone, uniting strength with neatness.&nbsp; It was
eight years and three quarters in completing, and cost
&pound;389,500 being more than double the cost of
Blackfriars&rsquo;.&nbsp; Westminster Bridge was opened for
carriages about midnight, by a procession of gentlemen, the chief
artificers, and a multitude of spectators.&nbsp; The architect
was not a native of this country: his name was Labelye.</p>
<p>Not far from the bridge, in old Palace Yard, stands
Westminster Hall.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Is thought to be the largest room in Europe unsupported by
pillars, being two hundred and seventy feet in length, and
seventy-four in breadth.&nbsp; The roof is of curious workmanship
in oak, and reminds the beholders of a grove of trees, whose top
branches extend toward each other till they unite.&nbsp; A great
feast was held in this vast apartment, and other rooms of the
palace, in the days of King Richard the Second, who is said to
have entertained ten thousand guests, with his usual
hospitality.</p>
<p>This hall was the court of justice in which the sovereign
presided in person.&nbsp; Hence the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench
took its name.&nbsp; Charles the First was tried here, and
condemned to suffer death by his own subjects.&nbsp; The trial of
peers, or of any person impeached by the Commons, has been
usually held here; and the coronation feasts have been celebrated
therein for many ages.</p>
<p>The ground on which the hall stands is so near to the water,
that on several high tides <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>the Thames has overflowed the hall,
the courts of justice have been broken up prematurely, and the
people conveyed away in boats.</p>

<p>Perhaps the streets of no city in the world are so well
lighted as those of London, there being lamps on each side of the
way, but a few yards distant from each other.&nbsp; It is said
that a foreign ambassador happening to enter London in the
evening, after the lamps were lighted, was so struck with the
brilliancy of the scene, that he imagined the streets had been
illuminated expressly in honour of his arrival.&nbsp; What would
he have thought, had he passed through the lustre which is shed
at present by the gas lights, from so many of our shops, and from
the lamps in the streets?&nbsp; The Lamplighters are a useful set
of men; and they are liable to many accidents while engaged in
their dangerous occupation.&nbsp; In the winter, the
foot-pavement is frequently so slippery, that they often fall and
are maimed, by the ladder&rsquo;s sliding from under them; or
sometimes a careless passenger runs against the ladder and throws
<a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>them
down.&nbsp; But one of their greatest difficulties is a high
wind.&nbsp; In October, 1812, a poor man, named Burke, who had
been many years in that employment, as he was lighting the lamps
on the east side of Blackfriars&rsquo; Bridge, was, by a sudden
gust of wind, blown into the river, in presence of his son, a
child of ten years old, and before assistance could be procured,
he sunk to rise no more.</p>

<p>This man has a comfortable great coat, a lantern, and a
rattle, with a large stick to attack thieves.&nbsp; I suppose my
readers would think it very wrong of him to sleep, and suffer
thieves to do as they please; and so it would.&nbsp; But I hope
no one will blame the watchman, and do as bad himself; for I have
known some little folks, who have had books and teachers, and

Indeed, sometimes when their teachers were looking at them, they
would appear to be very busy and attentive for a little while;
but when no one watched them, they would do as little as a

<p>If any of my little readers wish to be as healthy and merry as
Betty the milkmaid, they must work hard, and rise early in the
morning, instead of lying in bed while every body else <a

business, and idling their time till they go to bed again.&nbsp;
Betty is obliged to get up as soon as it is light, and then takes
a walk into the fields to fetch her cows.&nbsp; When she has
milked their full udders into her clean pails, she sets off
again, and carries it from door to door, time enough for her
customers to have it for breakfast.&nbsp; As every one knows the
business of a milkmaid, I shall say no more about it; but advise
those to remember her example, who wish to make themselves happy
or useful.</p>

<p>Tom Hazard was an unthinking boy, and would not settle to any
business at home, and so ventured one day in a frolic to go on
the water with a party of young folks; and, as Tom staid out late
at night, he was met on coming ashore by a press-gang, who took
him on board a man-of-war, from which, after some time, he made
his escape, and entered on board the <i>Desperate</i> Privateer,
hazarding his life for a golden chain, or a broken limb.&nbsp;
And now, poor fellow, when it is too late, he sorely laments his
situation, for, having lost a leg, he wanders <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>with some of
his companions, and joins in their mournful ditty.</p>
<blockquote><p>We poor sailors, lame and blind,<br />

Treat us not with words unkind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But a spark of pity shew.</p>

What a number of boats there are on the water!&nbsp; Let us hope

and has brought him back, quite senseless, to the boat.&nbsp; How
distressed his poor brother looks! and how anxious to see whether
there is any life left in him.</p>
<p>There is a society in London, of which Dr. Hawes and Dr.
Lettsom were the founders, for the purpose of recommending the
best means to be used for recovering drowned persons.&nbsp; It is
called the Humane Society.&nbsp; They have houses placed at
proper distances by the river-side, where assistance may be had
instantly; and every possible means are tried for many hours,
before they give any one quite over.&nbsp; Numbers have been
restored to life by this benevolent institution; and there is a
sermon preached once a year, before the Society, when many who
have been brought to life by this means are present: it is a very

Tuscan columns.&nbsp; This building was constructed under the

of this bridge to the public was conducted with unusual grandeur,
on the 18th of June, 1817; being the anniversary of the battle of
Waterloo, his late Majesty, then Prince Regent, and the Duke of
Wellington, with grand military cavalcade, attending.</p>

altogether a most delightful scene.&nbsp; The Londoners cannot
take a country walk whenever they please, and enjoy the green
fields and wild hedge-flowers, in the open air; but they may
supply themselves here with every kind of beautiful plants, for a

placed a magnificent cross, in memory of his beloved queen
Eleanor, <a name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"

of the reformers, who regarded it as an object of
superstition.&nbsp; <i>Le Sueur</i>, a French artist, cast a fine
statue in brass, of Charles the First on horseback, which was
erected in place of the cross.&nbsp; When Cromwell ruled, this
statue was sold to one <i>Revet</i>, a brazier, on condition of
his melting it, as the parliament had ordered that it should be
destroyed.&nbsp; Revet made a fortune by this statue, casting a
vast number of articles in bronze, as if made out of his
purchase, which <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

memorial of their prince; and by others, from the pleasure of
mean triumph over fallen royalty.&nbsp; Revet, however, had not
destroyed the statue, but kept it buried in the earth; and
Charles the Second, on his restoration, caused it to be erected
again.</p>

<p>These charity children are coming from church, with the two

children are taught to read, work, and write, in the different
charity-schools of London, and to do their duty to God and to
their neighbours; which will enable them to become respectable in
this world, and tend to make them happy in the next.</p>
<p>Once a year, about six thousand charity children, dressed in
uniforms of different colours, assemble in St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral, on benches raised to a great height one above the
other, circularly, under the dome.&nbsp; The order with which
each school finds its own situation, and the union of so many
voices, all raised at one moment to the praise of their great
Creator, as they chant the hundredth psalm on the entrance of the
clergyman, cause a most delightful and affecting sensation in the
minds of the spectators.&nbsp; The solemnity of the place, and
the hope that so much innocence, under such protection, would be
reared to virtue and happiness, must add greatly to the
effect.</p>
<p>This uncommon scene is well described in the following
lines.</p>

snow,<br />
Till into the high dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s, they, like
Thames&rsquo; waters, flow.<br />
Oh! what a multitude they seem&rsquo;d, these flowers of London
town!<br />
Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own!</p>
<p>The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs;<br
/>
Thousands of little boys and girls, raising their innocent
hands;<br />
Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song,<br

Or like harmonious thunderings, the seats of heav&rsquo;n
among.<br />
Beneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor:<br />
Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.</p>

more than a thousand hackney-coaches and chariots are sometimes

</a></p>
<p>What a picture of winter!&nbsp; The water in the leaden pipes,
leading from the large iron ones underground, into the houses, is
frozen.&nbsp; As some part of the pipe is generally exposed to
the cold air, this stoppage frequently happens in a frost, so
that the turn-cock is obliged to put a small wooden pipe into one
of the large ones underground, <a name="citation75"></a><a
href="#footnote75" class="citation">[75]</a> that the people may
procure water.&nbsp; The poor woman&rsquo;s cloak is frozen so <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>hard, that it
looks like a great wing.&nbsp; The little boy blows his fingers
to make them warmer: and there is a man throwing the snow off the
house, that it may not soak through to the chamber ceiling when a
thaw comes.&nbsp; What a blessing to have a good house and a
comfortable fire-side, when the weather is so severe.</p>
<h3>84.&nbsp; The Fire-plug.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The turn-cock, as he is called, has just opened a fire-plug,
or rather water-plug; but as its principal use is to supply water
to the engines for extinguishing fires, it has acquired the
former name, more from custom than propriety.&nbsp; Some boys
make rare sport, by putting one foot on the stream, and dividing
the course of the water; it is thus driven into the air, and over
their companions or passengers.</p>
<p>At first sight it seems impossible for water to run up hill;
and yet, by a little ingenuity, this is easily done; for, put
water into what you please, and one side or end of it will always
rise as high as the other.&nbsp; It is by knowing and thinking
about this, that clever men have contrived to supply whole cities
with water, and <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>even to send it up into the highest rooms of a
house.&nbsp; They first of all make a great reservoir, or
collection of water, on some neighbouring hill, from which pipes
are carried, underground, to all the houses they wish to supply;
the water in that end of the pipes next the town, always rising
as high as that in the reservoir at the other end of them.&nbsp;
If they cannot find a convenient spring, sufficiently high, they
force the water to a proper height by pumps and steam-engines;
and by these inventions, do with ease, what the best ancient
philosophers might have thought impossible.&nbsp; When one of the
great pipes, which run through the streets of London, happens to
burst, the water soon forces up the pavement, and a fountain is
produced.</p>

"The London Docks"

</a></p>
<p>Are situated in Wapping, between Ratcliffe Highway and the
Thames.&nbsp; One of the docks is so large, that it covers more
than twenty acres of ground, being 1262 feet long, and 699 feet
wide.&nbsp; It was first opened on the 31st of January,
1805.&nbsp; The new dock covers a space of fourteen <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>acres.&nbsp;
There are also immense warehouses.&nbsp; One of them is 762 feet
long, and 160 feet wide, a representation of which was too large
to introduce into our picture; but we have given a view of the
grand entrance, with a ship going into the docks, to be unladen
of her merchandise, which will be taken care of in one of those
warehouses, till it is sold for public use.</p>

<p>The wise and benevolent design of founding an hospital for
those brave men who have been disabled by age or accident, from
serving any longer in the navy, is said, to the honour of the
female sex, to have originated with that excellent woman, Queen
Mary, the wife of King William the Third; and the founding of an
asylum for invalid soldiers at Chelsea, was also attributed to a
female, one of King Charles the Second&rsquo;s favourites.&nbsp;
The buildings at each place are more like palaces than hospitals,
and great care is taken to render the objects of the institution
comfortable in their situations.&nbsp; The hospital at Chelsea,
with its appendages, covers above forty acres of ground.&nbsp;
There are three hundred and thirty-six in-door pensioners, and an
unlimited number of out-door pensioners, who receive an annual
allowance of seven pounds twelve shillings and sixpence
each.&nbsp; Greenwich Hospital admits two thousand three hundred
and fifty pensioners, who are provided with lodging, food,
clothing, and pocket-money; exclusive of about twelve hundred
out-pensioners, who receive seven pounds each per annum.&nbsp;
Both hospitals are situated by the water-side.&nbsp; At Chelsea,
the pensioners have gardens and fields to walk in; and at
Greenwich, there is a large and pleasant park.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
